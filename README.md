# Image-Classification-CNN
- Training a CNN from scratch to classify images from the CIFAR-100 dataset with different loss functions and comparing the results. 
- Trying out different combinations of convolution, batch norm, pooling and activation layers. Trying varying learning rates and weight decay hyperparameters as well to further analyse the results.
